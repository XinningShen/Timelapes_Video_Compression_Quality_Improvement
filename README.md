## If current timelapes video compression quality is not satisfied, try to change original parameter "-b:v 800K" to "-crf 28". 

## This will improve the quality of solution a lot (at least no apparent Mosaic in my view). At the same time, "-crf 28" will compress the size of video _**smaller**_ than before in most cases. If you want to get much better solution, try "-crf 26" or less AND the size of the video will increase as a result.
